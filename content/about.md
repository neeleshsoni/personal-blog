ðŸ‘‹, I am Neelesh Soni. I currently work at [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com). In the past I have worked for [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) and Pictor (CEO & Co-founder, acquired by Flipkart). Learn more here: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/neelesh-soni).

I spend my time [reading](https://neeleshsoni.com/bookshelf), listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bo69IQ7EvFx1xXkfZa8AC?si=7rfPi-GeSiCFD82RWtEXOA), and recently [writing](https://neeleshsoni.com/posts). I also love board-games, PS4, and Poker. I live in Bengaluru, with my adorable 6-month old, Ved and my lovely wife, Pallavi.

I'm not the best thinker or writer out there, nor have I achieved any unique successes. And, I have let that come in the way of sharing my experiences online, but I recently rediscovered [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4PuMLJPJ4YftrUtYQYn8Zd?si=X7a40vyrQVWbE1p_PskNQg), it gave me the confidence of putting my soup of words out there.

Always open for a discussion about products, strategy, startups, and parenting.

GL HF ;)
